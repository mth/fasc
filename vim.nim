# TODO
#  * Parse call plug#begin() ... call plug#end()
#  * Changing/adding set foo= and PREFIX setlocal foo=
#    (vim allows multiple assignments after set)
#    Possible approximation - simple prefix check (could be done with flag to appendMissing)
#  * Adding unique source directives (can be done with appendMissing)
#  * Write default colors and some other configurations
